	In cryptography, encryption is the process of transforming information (referred to as plaintext)
using an algorithm (called cipher) to make it unreadable to anyone except those possessing special knowledge,
usually referred to as a key. The result of the process is encrypted information 
(in cryptography, referred to as ciphertext).
